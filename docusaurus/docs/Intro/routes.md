# More About Routes

In this section we'll show how to move beyond simple CRUD requests, as shown in [Getting Started](Intro/first.md).

# Customizing CRUD Further

<!-- FIXME: move into extra chapter? -->

CRUD generation is customizable; more detail and syntax around this and also security policy is coming soon but
here is a lower-level example that does not expose the writing endpoints (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) while
wrapping the result with either `{"data": VALUE}` or `{"error": "message"}`, depending on the result.

<!-- FIXME: replace with class based alternates once available -->

```typescript title="my-backend/routes/comments-readonly.ts"
import { crud, responseFromJson } from "@chiselstrike/api";
import { BlogComment } from "../models/BlogComment";

function createResponse(body: unknown, status: number): Response {
    if (status < 400) {
        return responseFromJson({ data: body["results"] }, status);
    }
    return responseFromJson({ error: body }, status);
}

export default crud(
    BlogComment,
    { write: false, createResponse }
);
```

## Full Custom Routes

Being able to just get started very quickly and spawn a CRUD API is great, but as your
project evolves in complexity you may find yourself needing custom business logic and HTTP requests
that don't fit neatly into REST workflows. This is a big advantage of ChiselStrike, since you will
be able to express complex logic, sometimes dealing with multiple models and queries, with a single
roundtrip.

ChiselStrike uses a two-tiered approach to routing. First, we perform file-based routing, so for example the
file `routes/comments.ts` will receive all HTTP requests under the path "/comments". Second, we look at the
`RouteMap` object that is `default export`-ed from the file to see whether any of the given routes matches the
remainder of the path.

The first route that matches will handle the request. This means that we will call the request handler
function, passing a `ChiselRequest` (a subclass of
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)) to it as argument. The function may be
async and it should return a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). If you
return a string, we will return it in the response as-is, other values will be first converted to JSON using
`responseFromJson`.

For example, here's how you can have a specialized endpoint that returns all posts:

```typescript title="my-backend/routes/allcomments.ts"
import { RouteMap } from "@chiselstrike/api";
import { BlogComment } from "../models/BlogComment"

export default new RouteMap()
    .get("/", async function() : Promise<Array<BlogComment>> {
        return BlogComment.findAll()
    });
```

You can also define dynamic routes, which take parameters in the URL path, using the `:parameter` syntax:

```typescript title="my-backend/routes/onecomment.ts"
import { BlogComment } from "../models/BlogComment"
import { ChiselRequest, RouteMap } from "@chiselstrike/api"

export default new RouteMap()
    .get("/:id", async function (req: ChiselRequest) : Promise<BlogComment> {
        const id = req.params.get("id");
        return BlogComment.findOne({id});
    });
}
```

In fact, we support the full syntax of the [URL Pattern
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API), so you can use advanced features like
regex matching.

:::tip
You can't change data during a `GET` request. Make sure that if you are making changes to the backend state,
they happen under `PUT`, `POST`, or `DELETE`!
:::

Now let's edit our code to show off a "full customization" example.

```typescript title="my-backend/routes/comments.ts"
import { ChiselRequest, RouteMap, responseFromJson } from "@chiselstrike/api"
import { BlogComment } from "../models/BlogComment"

async function handlePost(req: ChiselRequest): Promise<BlogComment> {
    const payload = await req.json();
    const by = payload["by"] || "anonymous";
    const content = payload["content"];
    // no await needed, this is Promise<BlogComment>
    return BlogComment.create({ content, by });
}

async function handleGetOne(req: ChiselRequest): Promise<Response> {
    const id = req.params.get("id");
    const comment = await BlogComment.findOne({id})
    const status = comment ? 200 : 404;
    // notice how now we had to await findOne, as we wanted to build a Response
    return responseFromJson(comment, status)
}

async function handleGetAll(req: ChiselRequest): Promise<Array<BlogComment>> {
    // no await needed, this is Promise<Array<BlogComment>>
    return BlogComment.findAll();
}

export default new RouteMap()
    .post("/", handlePost)
    .get("/:id", handleGetOne)
    .get("/", handleGetAll);
```

:::tip
Remember how we didn't have to specify an `id` in the model? We can now access it
as `created.id` in the example above. If the object doesn't have an `id`, one is created for you after
`create` or `save`.
:::

:::tip
Notice that right now using `findOne` to access an object that does not exist returns a null value, rather
than raising an error. This may change in the near future. We do our own explicit
error checking in this example.
:::

With this example, we're now getting to know ChiselStrike's API and runtime better. Notice how
we were able to parse the request under `POST` with our own custom validation, and then use
the `build` API to construct an object that is then persisted with `save`.  We'll explain the use of the
data model more in [Data Access](Intro/data-access).

Finally, notice the `responseFromJson` convenience method, which takes a JavaScript object and serializes it into a
`Response` ready to be returned.

Let's now test our request handler with a POST, and see it works similarly to the automatic "CRUD" example above.

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"content": "Fifth comment", "by": "Jill"}' localhost:8080/dev/comments
```

and `curl` should return something like:

```console
{"id":"7190f1c5-7b81-4180-9db5-2d9c6ce17d6d","content":"Fifth comment","by":"Jill"}
```

Now lets fetch the entire list of comments:


```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/dev/comments
```

and we should see something like the following:

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "content": "First comment",
            "by": "Jill"
        },
        {
            "content": "Second comment",
            "by": "Jack"
        },
        {
            "content": "Third comment",
            "by": "Jim"
        },
        {
            "content": "Fourth comment",
            "by": "Jack"
        },
        {
            "content": "Fifth comment",
            "by": "Jill"
        }
    ]
}
```


ðŸŽ‰ Nice! You've gone from a simple REST API to learning how to write full custom endpoints using the full data model.
It's time to explore our API in greater depth, then you can set out and explore other documentation sections according
to your interests!

## Code sharing between routes

It is common for routes to share more code than just the models. If
the common code is already published as module, the module can be
imported directly:

```typescript title="my-backend/routes/indented.ts"
import { RouteMap } from '@chiselstrike/api';
import indent from 'https://deno.land/x/text_indent@v0.1.0/mod.ts';

export default new RouteMap()
    .get("/", (req: Request) => "the following is indented" + indent("foo", 16));
```

But for code that is specific to a project and not publicly available,
the module can be placed in a directory next to the routes. By
convention that directory is named lib, but any other name would
work. For example:

```typescript title="my-backend/lib/hello.ts"
export function hello(): string {
    return "Welcome to ChiselStrike";
}
```

```typescript title="my-backend/routes/day.ts"
import { RouteMap } from "@chiselstrike/api";
import { hello } from "../lib/hello.ts";

export default new RouteMap()
    .get("/", async function (req: Request) {
        const msg = hello();
        return new Response(`${msg}\n Have a nice day.`);
    });
```

## CRUD paging

Most of the examples we have used so far used rather small datasets. In the real world, datasets tend
to grow rather quickly and, for example, we can easily imagine storing thousands of comments.
Retrieving them all at once would be inefficient and usually unnecessary. That's where CRUD's
built-in paging comes into play.

The default page size is set to be 1000 elements. Let's restrict that a bit more to see how it works:

```bash
curl -g localhost:8080/dev/comments?sort=by&.by~like=Ji%25&page_size=2
```

which gives us

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "content": "First comment",
            "by": "Jill"
        },
        {
            "content": "Fifth comment",
            "by": "Jill"
        }
    ],
    "next_page": "/dev/comments?.by~like=Ji%25&page_size=2&cursor=eyJheGV..."
}
```

Apparently, we got a new entry in the response - `next_page`. This is a link that will take us to the
next page of results. You can notice that the `sort` parameter is gone. That is because it's now
embedded in a new parameter `cursor` in which we encoded how to get to the next page. While you can't
modify the sort, you can freely modify other parameters like filtering or page size.

Based on the parameters, the **cursor will ensure that you will only get entities that come after the
last element on the current page**. This is a very useful property as it makes sure that you don't
get duplicate elements if insertion happens when transitioning between pages (similarly for deletions).

So let's continue and follow the next_page link:

```bash
curl -g localhost:8080/dev/comments?.by~like=Ji%25&page_size=2&cursor=eyJheGV...
```

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "content": "Third comment",
            "by": "Jim"
        },
    ],
    "prev_page": "/dev/comments?.by~like=Ji%25&page_size=2&cursor=GVzIjpe..."
}
```

This gives us the remainder of the results as well as a link to the previous page that would take us
back where we came from. Similarly to the next page situation, the `cursor` parameter in this case
ensures that you will get elements that come before the first element of current page, in current
sort.

### Why cursor-based paging?

Compared to the classical offset-based paging, cursor paging has two main benefits.

First big advantage is that cursor-based paging is **stable**. This means that if you do insertions
resp. deletions while transitioning between pages, you won't miss entries resp. won't get duplicates.
Those problems can be very annoying to deal with.

Second advantage is **efficiency**. Paging using the standard offset approach can be very inefficient
when filters are used. The reason for this is that the database needs to go through all candidate
rows and apply the filter until it finds offset-number of valid entries and only then it starts
filling the page.

Cursor-based paging on the other hand leverages the user-specified sort (primary key sorting is used
if no sort is specified) and uses the elements as pivots. This way we can directly jump to the pivot
using index and start filling the page from there.
